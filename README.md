# Division by Zero in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: division by zero.  The provided code shows a basic example and how to handle such errors more robustly.

## Bug Description
The `divide` function does not adequately handle the case where the divisor is zero.  While it throws an error, this approach can lead to abrupt application termination or unexpected behavior in a complex application.

## Solution
The solution offers improved error handling using a try-catch block or returning a default value to prevent the application from crashing.
